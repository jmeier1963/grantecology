      "Description  The European Union (EU) has led the world in demonstrating the feasibility of ambitious action on climate change. It now faces the dual challenge of implementing its political commitment to reduce emissions by 40% by 2030 against 1990 levels, whilst also putting in place the foundations of the deeper transformation of the energy sector necessary to limit global warming to 2°C.The European Climate Foundation (ECF) is a major philanthropic initiative, established in early 2008 to help Europe foster the development of a low-carbon society and play an even stronger international leadership role to mitigate climate change. It has established itself as a hub of expertise in strategising, aligning and coordinating between a wide range of partners in the private and public sectors.The ECF works with stakeholders as diverse as industry representatives, unions and consumer groups to target a range of issues across the power, transport and energy sectors. These include EU climate and energy policy, finance, governance and innovation.The ECF promotes new regulation to mitigate climate change, in addition to supporting partners in revising and improving existing policies such as the Emissions Trading Scheme. It aims to contribute to a potential Europe-wide reduction in emissions amounting to 3 billion tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2030.CIFF also supports ECF’s industrial programme, targeting the carbon performance of European industry and imported industrial goods. ECF aims to catalyse the establishment of a shared European industrial vision and regulatory framework that achieves both competitiveness and decarbonisation.Climate change standards developed in Europe have traditionally served as a template for policy in other regions. By supporting the EU in its transition to a low-carbon economy, ECF may offer models of best practice for other nations striving to prevent climate change.CIFF’s support will enable ECF to pursue two key objectives. First it will help European leadership to implement its commitment to a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030. Second, it will help establish the policy framework required for deeper transformation, with an 80-95% reduction in view.CIFF has been working with the ECF for several years.

This means accelerating decarbonisation and avoiding lock-in of high carbon infrastructure before 2020.C40's core mission, working in close collaboration with mayors, city practitioners and technical partners, is to support cities to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.C40 is a network that connects more than 90 of the world's greatest cities, representing 650+ million people and one quarter of the global economy. It engages, supports and commits mayors to take actions on climate change and facilitates technical assistance and peer-to-peer exchange (sharing best practices) across mobility, land use planning, energy, buildings and waste sectors.For more than a decade, mayors of the world's largest cities have been among the most outspoken and boldest innovators in taking climate action.Through C40's thematic networks, city officials advise and learn from each other about the successes and challenges of implementing climate action. These provide a platform for cities to showcase their climate action solutions and inspire their city peers.C40 networks also help cities engage with technical experts and undertake collective actions that demonstrate the power of cities working together. By showcasing the leadership of these mayors, C40 is setting the global agenda on what true commitment to climate action means for political leaders at every level.Leading climate cities will deliver Paris-compatible Climate Action Plans that spell out how each city will achieve a carbon neutral status by 2050.

      "Description  Energy Foundation’s China Sustainable Cities Programme and the World Resources Institute (WRI) EMBARQ programme are using international best practice and technical assistance in city demonstration projects to provide a policy and implementation blueprint to cities on the use of climate-smart urban design principles.They are building an improved evidence database by supporting research on the technical challenges and solutions to the implementation of transit-oriented development principles, and building increased capacity by training key implementers (e.g. mayors, planners) and advocates (e.g. urban sustainability non-governmental organisations) in China, as well as sharing knowledge with other cities in China.To communicate the findings and messages of the research, WRI ran a very successful campaign in 2016 to promote the use of public transport as an approach to making the city more sustainable.  To better communicate their work, a blog series on transit-oriented development has been published to engage the wider public. In addition, as well an interview with Jan Gehl, a leading architect, has been widely distributed by relevant national and local news media such as the Paper and Oriental Daily.The investment will contribute to achieving the abatement potential of around 318 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2030. In addition, it will contribute to increased take up of a model of development that reduces car dependency and increases modal shift, reduces the lock-in of high-carbon road infrastructure, limits urban sprawl, and improves transport efficiency and air quality.The communication collaterals produced as part of this project have been widely used and applied by others, including by the World Bank’s Knowledge Hub. The messages in these materials have now been disseminated to over ten cities in China, supported by China-GEF-World Bank Urban Transport Partnership Program Project.\n",

      "Description  Air conditioners are a double burden when it comes climate change. They use the extremely potent greenhouse gases HFCs and use a significant amount of energy.With the world’s air conditioners expected to increase from 900 million units today to 2.5 billion in 2050 this double burden in set to accelerate to unprecedented levels.To learn more about HFCs and how phasing down their use can make a real difference in the fight against climate change, watch the video below.The Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development and a team of experts are working to help governments and industry around the world, including in India and China, to increase the energy efficiency of air conditioners in parallel with the phase down of super-polluting HFC refrigerants.Since 2009, we have committed more than $26 million to the global phase-down of HFCs.This grant also forms the basis of CIFF’s commitment to the Clean Energy Ministerial’s Advanced Cooling Challenge , a campaign urging governments and industry to develop and deploy at scale super-efficient, smart, climate-friendly, and affordable cooling technologies.A rapid global phase down of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) has the potential to mitigate 100 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent or more.But this is only half of what can be achieved through the phase down of HFCs. By increasing energy efficiency of air conditioners at the same time it is possible to mitigate an additional 100 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050.A double transition in the air conditioning sector could avoid building up to 2500 peak power plants globally by 2050, including 710 in China and 510 in India.\n",

      "Description  Cities are major centres of resource and energy consumption, and therefore of greenhouse gas emissions. Unless addressed, per capita emissions from emerging cities in the developing world will, by 2030, be on a par with existing megacities.To limit global temperature rise to less than 2C, emissions in developed cities must be reduced and developing cities must be supported in achieving low-emissions growth, avoiding further carbon lock-in.This investment will help create a critical mass of cities across the world quantifying their urban emissions and setting robust reduction targets using an international goal standard - Global Protocol for Community Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC). In addition, this will showcase the feasibility of monitoring, reporting and verification which is a requirement proposed for countries under the international climate negotiations that will lead to a global climate treaty in 2015.C40 will provide technical assistance, tools, guidance and training to 30 targeted C40 cities to support them to credibly measure their emissions, understand the key sources, and set robust and ambitious targets for climate action. The 30 cities in the programme have been selected based on the risk of lock-in of future emissions, powers to implement, political window of opportunity and capacity.This will create a global critical mass of cities measuring and reporting their emissions on a consistent basis, enabling comparison between geographies and provide exemplars for other cities to follow.This is recognised as critical to accelerate the scale-up of climate action and will enable cities to comply with key requirements of the Compact of Mayors, the largest collaboration of mayors identified as progressives on climate change and city action.This investment will establish as a norm the use of data on greenhouse gas emissions by mayors in their planning, prioritisation and performance monitoring processes. It will accelerate the likelihood of city action and provide the first robust, bottom-up estimate of urban emissions data to enable an assessment of the contribution of cities to close the ‘gap’ between national emissions pledges and the reductions needed to achieve the 2C target.C40 has released the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities (GPC) Interactive Dashboard, an exciting new tool that allows users to explore and compare the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of C40 member cities reported through the Global Protocol for Community-scale GHG Emission Inventories. The tool currently has in its database the GHG emissions data of 28 C40 cities, allowing member cities and the public to explore the efforts and progress C40 cities are collectively making in reducing the causes and impacts of climate change.\n",

      "Description  In the lead up to the 21st Conference of the Parties under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 185 countries submitted national climate plans (INDCs) outlining how they will act on climate change after 2020.While the INDCs are encouraging, they are not enough to limit global temperature rise below 2C in order to avoid the worst climate impacts. As a consequence, the challenge for governments and the international community going forward lies not only in effective implementation of these national climate plans, but also in raising their ambition.Effective systems of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of progress of national climate actions are at the core of addressing this challenge.‘Measurement’ is key to determining the impact and effectiveness of climate policies and actions as it can inform national decision making processes, enabling countries to more effectively identify, design and improve their most promising climate policies to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Standardised ‘reporting’ of this information and ‘verification’ of results by an independent third party are key to achieving accurate and comparable reporting at the international level. Such transparency is needed to facilitate an international dialogue rooted in trust, which is central to unlocking a spiralling-up of ambition.Catalysing improvements in national and international MRV efforts to address this need is precisely the impact this investment seeks to achieve.With co-funding from the German Environment Ministry, this investment will support the first phase of the MRV Initiative, a multi-stakeholder initiative that will address the gaps in capacity for MRV for climate policy and actions.This first phase will be led by Verified Carbon Standard, UNEP DTU Partnership and World Resources Institute, who were selected trough a competitive process. Together, they will work towards two main outcomes:The initiative will be administered through a multi-stakeholder trust fund housed at the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). Under this politically neutral set up, donors contribute to a joint work program supporting MRV. Additional donors will be able to join the trust fund at any time and the additional funds will be used to expand the scope of the MRV initiative to new areas such as climate change adaptation.The strategic direction of the work will be guided by a Donor Oversight Committee, made up of donors and a representative from UNOPS, in close consultation with an Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee will be made up of leading international experts in MRV-related fields with strong global south representation. Representatives from the implementing partners will participate in an Initiative Coordination Team which will coordinate guidance development and capacity building.In April 2016, the Initiative for Climate Action Transparency (ICAT) was launched. The mission of ICAT is to help build the capacity of developing countries to measure the impacts of their climate actions while fostering greater transparency, effectiveness, trust and ambition in climate policies worldwide. The project will work to build capacity within at least 20-30 developing countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean.\n",

      "Description  In advance of the Kigali Amendment, 18 foundations and individuals offered support for fast-start developing countries to expand energy efficiency while phasing out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).This resulted in the Kigali Cooling Efficiency Program (K-CEP), a $52 million philanthropic program which focuses on increasing the energy efficiency of cooling in developing countries to increase and accelerate the climate and development benefits of the Kigali Amendment to phase down HFCs.K-CEP aims to do this in a number of ways, which are reflected in its four funding windows:CIFF supports the Efficiency Cooling Office (ECO) which serves as the K-CEP program office, providing grant-making, reporting, program management, and other services to help K-CEP funders and partners maximize the climate and development benefits of K-CEP.Under the Kigali Amendment, 197 countries committed to cut the production and consumption of HFCs - potent greenhouse gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning - by more than 80 percent over the next 30 years. This effort has the potential to avoid up to 0.5° C of global warming by the end of the century.But this is only half of what can be achieved through the phase down of HFCs. By increasing energy efficiency of cooling appliances at the same time, such as air conditioners and refrigerators, it is possible to double the climate benefit.The Kigali Cooling Efficiency Program aims to support the Kigali Amendment of the Montreal Protocol to deliver these energy efficiency benefits in parallel with the HFC phase down.\n",

Some CGE technologies (e.g. solar radiation management), however, would have significant, centuries-long and planetary-wide consequences – the intergenerational dimensions are therefore significant.CGE technologies are rapidly evolving from the theoretical to being tested in the real world.  In the foreseeable future, governments and non-state actors could turn to geoengineering options as a last resort and/or a means to buy time.There is an urgent need for a broad, inclusive global governance discussion regarding the research, possible testing and deployment, and decision-making process for CGE technologies. Without appropriate checks and balances, and accountability of those who are pursuing this agenda, there is a risk that detrimental developments could be pursued. It is imperative that geoengineering be governed, and that its intergenerational equity dimensions will be well considered by policymakers. Intergenerational concerns, as well as the perspectives of young people, must be at the heart of any ethical deliberation of global geoengineering governance.The Climate Geoengineering Governance Project (CGGP) seeks to enlarge, accelerate and shift the discussion on CGE governance from academia to civil society and the intergovernmental policy community.

      "Description  Cities are at the forefront of the fight against climate change: around 70% of global energy is consumed in cities, leading to a similar share of global CO2 emissions being emitted in cities.This means that rapid climate action at city level is needed to constrain demand for energy through the deployment of cleaner policies and infrastructure in various sectors such as transport, planning, waste, etc.Fortunately, cities have often demonstrated a high level of ambition and have helped lead the way to support the transition to a low carbon economy. In some cases, this has meant that cities have acted first, with national governments following this leadership. Being responsible for the daily lives of city residents has helped many officials and mayors to understand that providing a climate-safe future promises multiple benefits - such as cleaner air, sustainable jobs and energy security.Click here to learn about the role cities can play in the fight against climate change.However, cities’ commitments to act need to be strengthened and supported by civil society. They need to have access to the tools, guidance and international best practice examples that will help them to implement the most ambitious climate actions. Moreover, continued effort is needed to tackle barriers to city delivery such as access to finance, lack of adequate decentralisation of power from national governments or weak partnerships with the private sector.To address these challenges, CIFF decided to renew its support to C40 in its fight against climate change for another three years. C40 is a network of 90 of the world’s megacities committed to addressing climate change. Together the C40 network accounts for over half a billion city residents from all continents, with a balanced representation of Global North and Global South cities. Now established as one of the main platforms for cities who want to tackle climate change, C40 is a data driven, best practice network aiming to catalyse ambition and support better and faster implementation.C40 does this by:C40 also engages in international forums to amplify the voice of its members, showcase their successes and push for more ambition from other stakeholders.This investment aimed to contribute to C40 cities' achievement of 1.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent of cumulative mitigation potential by 2030, and to provide a platform for the global leverage and replication of best practice climate-smart principles. With CIFF's support. C40 has played a significant role in increasing the visibility and credibility of cities taking the lead on climate mitiation, deploying policies, strategies, and approaches that embed this into city governance.C40 also helped to catalyse climate action from its members, as detailed in the Climate Action in Megacities 3.0 report. As a platform, it has been successful in motivating mayors through peer-to-peer pressure and in providing the relevant support at the technical level to implement commitments. The research produced by C40 staff has changed the way cities’ role in fighting climate change is understood. This has helped to establish C40 as one of the key on-state actor voices in the run-up to COP21, playing a critical role in raising ambition and securing an ambitious Paris Agreement.An evaluation, led by Ramboll, is being finalised. It shows that the work delivered is of high quality and comforts the view that C40 is a valued partner for cities. It confirms that C40 membership and the network’s activities indirectly contribute to better implementation of climate action – although more direct links between their support and tangible climate action is harder to establish.\n",

It aims to build capacity to implement climate-smart urban principles in Brazil, to identify champions for these new norms who can implement iconic demonstration projects (city mayors), and to encourage and enable the replication of successful examples. This should lead to the institutionalisation of climate-smart urban transportation and planning principles in city mobility plans and regulations and codes.In parallel, by supporting and encouraging the Ministry of Cities, Caixa Econômica Federal (CAIXA) and the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) to make funding conditional on consistency with these principles, a pipeline of low carbon infrastructure will be developed. In turn, this will contribute to the emergence of a new pattern of urban development and a decisive curbing of the growth in Brazil’s urban transport emissions. The investment also aims to encourage replication of the model within Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America.To accomplish these objectives, CIFF provided a grant to two organisations operating in Brazil — World Resources Institute (WRI) Brasil Cidades Sustentáveis (Sustainable Cities) and the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) Brasil.Together, they work in a number of key Brazilian cities (including Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo) by providing technical assistance to local and federal stakeholders and building their climate-smart urbanisation capacity, by generating research and gathering international best practice examples to inform mobility plans and investment decision and by engaging key constituencies to increase the support to more sustainable transport policies.The investment aims to contribute to realising an abatement potential of 164 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent cumulatively by 2030. This will be accomplished through a modal shift from private cars to public or non-motorised transport, increased access to Bus Rapid Transit, and reduced travel times for passengers. This will directly impact over 40 million lives in Brazil’s iconic cities, including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia and Belo Horizonte, by delivering world-class demonstration projects which will in turn influence actions, policies and financing in other cities, and on national and international levels.This programme has faced a challenging context during its first two years, with a serious economic crisis and a changing political environment. However, WRI and ITDP, widely praised for their work, have been successful in navigating these difficulties, adjusting their work programme and securing progress towards the overall objectives of this programme. There are many examples of this programme making a difference: ITDP and WRI, for example, have been critical on the successful implementation of key BRT projects and on pushing for the development of non-motorised transportation (cycling and walking). WRI’s Seven Steps – How to Build an Urban Mobility Plan has been endorsed by the Ministry of Cities and downloaded more than 10,000 times. ITDP has developed urban mobility indicators that are being officially tested in a pilot phase. Although the transformational changes sought by this programme are likely to take longer, there are signs that climate-smart urbanisation principles start to be institutionalised in Brazil.CIFF has commissioned Ross Strategic to do an evaluation of this programme. A first mid-line report has been produced that confirms the progress and achievements secured by the grantees. It also highlights a few gaps in the theory of change that need to be tackled to maximise the impact of this programme and identifies key lessons. These will be taken on board by the programme going forward.\n",

      "Description  International experiences have demonstrated that transit-oriented development measures – such as designing compact neighbourhoods with homes near offices, shops and recreational facilities – can significantly reduce pollution from vehicles and improve overall quality of life.In the context of rapid urbanisation in China, the investment aimed to help move China’s emerging megacities off of a high-polluting car-oriented trajectory by applying eight low carbon design principles. These principles illustrate the feasibility of reducing cities’ carbon emissions through designs that avoid unnecessary motorised trips and shift journeys to public transport, walking and cycling – the concept of transit-oriented development.This investment helped the China Sustainable Cities Programme build up relationships to support government (national and city) and to successfully demonstrate the feasibility of sustainability concepts on the ground.CIFF’s partner, Energy Foundation China, helped the government pilot transit-oriented development measures, by providing guidance and technical assistance to local officials and research centres.A third-party evaluation confirmed that the investment achieved its core goals and that the approach of working with sub-national governments to pilot and then scale up best practice worked well in the Chinese policy context. Through CIFF’s support, Energy Foundation China launched 14 urban pilot projects (new town projects and re-developments). Out of the six new town projects, where data is available, all are meeting appropriate technical standards.At the end of the programme, four of the projects had completed the full cycle from design, government approval to initiation of construction. Kunming and Chongqing are the most advanced in terms of progress.  In Chongqing, Energy Foundation China was invited by the government to help develop the land transfer contracts to ensure compliance with the regulatory plan. Overall, the majority of the pilots have completed at least the design and approval phases.The programme also made good progress in helping to support a national policy framework to favour sustainable urbanisation, providing input on the 13th Five Year Plan, and supporting the revision and development of technical guidelines and standards with two ministries.The evaluation found that the partners have strong credibility with the cities and policy makers to affect change. However, the evaluation also pointed to some areas for improvement, and suggested the partners focus on fewer principles and deepen support to capacity building with cities to ensure the programme would have a lasting impact. The approval of China’s New Urbanization Plan 2014-2020 signalled an important ‘tail wind’ for further work. CIFF and Energy Foundation China worked to incorporate these lessons and experiences to improving results in a larger, five year collaboration on sustainable urbanisation in China.It has used the lessons learned to support government adoption of policies to promote walking and cycling, and scale-up is starting to happen. In addition, the programme helped ensure the transit-oriented development concept was included in the government’s New Urbanisation Plan (2014-2020).\n",

These fed into the facilitated stakeholder process at the heart of the MAPS. The technical and stakeholder work of MAPS, in building this knowledge and capacity in each of the four participating countries, has been assessed to have successfully and significantly increased the basis for future climate action. It is very likely that the skills, knowledge, processes and networks developed by MAPS will be sustained.The independent evaluation of MAPS found that the programme was able to successfully insert itself into the climate change mitigation strategy processes in each of the four countries, and as a result was able to contribute to (although as one of many influences) the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) in each country. MAPS main influence was assessed to have been in making the basis of the INDC commitments more robust, realistic and actionable than those of other, similar, non-MAPS countries.The key factors in achieving these outcomes and impacts were the legitimacy, relevance and credibility of the MAPS team and process, and also that the MAPS teams remained as politically neutral as possible within the process. The MAPS process itself was assessed to be quite unique in the sphere of climate mitigation, well timed and an excellent example of South-South collaboration.

The VERENA team participated in the Investment Forum in New York organised by the UN Foundation, during which the VERENA project was invited to present their innovative economic model, a financial model of restoration using native species in Brazil, galvanising support of the VERENA approach from private investors, NGOs, and governments representatives from both countries.The investment will contribute to Brazil’s goal of net zero deforestation by 2020.The VERENA model was presented to a group of Brazilian investors in August 2016 in a prototype test to better determine the variables and assumptions inherent in the work. The outcome was a more robust business model, built upon on-the-ground data from about 5,000 hectare of forest plantations representing two ecosystems (i.e. Amazon and Atlantic Forest) in Brazil, for the development of native species restoration investments.\n",

It is led by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis (JISEA) and carried out in cooperation with government and local stakeholders, drawing upon an international community of power system expertise.A shift in Mexico’s power sector will provide an essential foundation for achieving a potential reduction in emissions of 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2020 and 130-155 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2030.Since the start of the investment, Mexico has made some institutional progress towards increased penetration of renewables.

It also sought to determine the long-term global emissions scenarios arising from the pledges and aggregate other relevant sectors, such as land use, aviation, marine and fluorinated gases.The project quantified and evaluated proposed emissions reductions commitments contained in countries' Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) ahead of the Paris Agreement. The evaluation also undertook a global aggregation to provide long-term (year 2100) temperature projections that supported broader analysis and understanding of how ambitious the INDCs were.The aim was to provide a robust evidence base by which INDC commitments could be judged individually and collectively. The goal was to increase ambition, both within the INDCs themselves and within the dynamics of the Paris process.The Climate Action Tracker (CAT) team mobilised to complete analysis of 33 INDCs with rapid turnaround, producing briefings for selected countries. Through this, CAT was able to develop a robust assessment of the global temperature implications of the targets contained in the INDCs, despite the late publication of many INDCs.This investment aimed to provide incentives both to reduce emissions unilaterally and to participate constructively in multilateral negotiations. By enhancing transparency around the global adequacy of national pledges, this investment provided robust and objective analyses that a range of actors can deploy to enhance ambition.CAT was very active in communicating the results of its work, which was essential for the wider community to have a good grasp of the INDC landscape. The team published a number of briefings and it quickly became established as the go-to source for media looking for insight into the implications of the national commitments. The website had very high visitor traffic, and was designed to provide a clear insight into country level commitments and aggregate emission projections. There is good evidence that the press relied heavily on CAT analysis, with a number of leading outlets (Reuters, Bloomberg, Guardian, BBC) using CAT-derived data and infographics.While the efforts of CAT were targeted primarily directed toward the run up to Paris, the successful approach created a strong analytical basis for future analysis of the emissions gap.\n",

Reports were prepared by country teams with a view to building capacity in countries that needed this technical assistance, as well as within the wider policy community, around the concept of long-term pathways out to 2050.The synthesis report was launched by a high-level panel and disseminated at an international level (through IDDRI dialogues and briefings). National reports were launched through a series of events in the relevant country and were branded locally to help with political traction.By the successful conclusion of COP21, 62 INDCs included references to a long-term goal as a benchmark for short-term action as defined in the INDC, including: United States, Mexico, the EU, Brazil and others.Click here to access the Deep Decarbonisation Pathways Project reports and documents.\n",

      "Description  The Climate Briefing Service provided high-quality political analysis of key aspects of the climate negotiations that led to the Paris Agreement. Many of the core concepts of the Agreement (and the negotiating elements leading up to it) were highly complex and often difficult to understand for those outside of the process. CBS played a very important role in translating the complex language to its audiences through providing unbranded, jargon-free sector-relevant interpretations for others to use in their own policy and advocacy work, providing its network with evidence-based resources for tactical interventions.It played an instrumental role in coordinating advocacy and alignment of communication and messages amongst its key stakeholder group. This was largely done through convening events and workshops that not only disseminated its political analysis, but also offered capacity building for many groups to support their own understanding of the policy in order to underpin impactful communication of messages.CBS also played a role in mobilising actors (those engaging in the UN climate change process) to be bold in their efforts to collaborate in unprecedented ways (across for example sectors and geographies) to show that climate change being a complex and global problem requires a global and inter-connected coalition of actors to work on the solutions. This collaboration helped to empower many actors that might not otherwise have had the opportunities to participate in the process and engage in advocacy – which resulted in a spectrum of messages being communicated, contributing to an overwhelming sense of ‘togetherness’ offering diverse perspectives on why a strong climate agreement would benefit the whole world.The Paris Agreement was a historic turning point, embedding climate science in the heart of the political agreement, and aligning 195 countries to decouple their prosperity and development from fossil fuel use. Diverse constituencies and leading voices relied upon the briefings and intelligence during COP21, contributing to the alignment of voices and the creation of the political space needed to bring about the success.The Climate Briefing Service (CBS) played a critical role in ensuring that its wider networks were kept up to speed on the developments of the climate negotiations throughout 2015 in the lead up to COP21.  Its function was to support its network to advocate for a strong global climate agreement that would lay out concrete and ambitious long-term goals and a means to undertake regular rounds of ambition to deliver those obligations.In addition, CBS played a role to support these actors in amplifying the commitments they were making, which aligned with the broad objectives of the Paris Agreement; as well as to communicate a willingness to support governments in the implementation of country-specific plans. This advocacy and demonstration of willingness to work alongside governments gave them the confidence to take bold steps in putting offers on the table that underpinned a strong outcome.In supporting these efforts CBS helped facilitate the communication of the most important messages tailored to each constituency that led to the historical deal in Paris being reached. Critically, CBS also supported a policy of longevity and durability of the Paris Agreement, which is already being demonstrated by the fact that on Earth Day (April 22) 175 governments met in Paris to sign the Agreement and show their commitment to continue to work on its implementation.The CBS continues to play a pivotal role in climate action and the fight against climate change.\n",

It displays data and trends for over 130 indicators that determine GHG pathways for many of the world's economies.This web-platform is underpinned by peer-reviewed CTI Models to determine GHG pathways between 2010 and 2030, across all sectors of the economy for select geographies. The models are open and available to anyone to run custom scenarios to provide deeper analysis into any region or sector the models cover.The CTI was formally launched in 2016 and the tool and materials are now publicly available for use. CIFF's funding is supporting the next level of development of the Carbon Transparency Initiative, expanding the CTI tools, models and datasets to additional developing countries.Transparency and accountability are key components to implementing the Paris Agreement. The tools and analyses made available through the CTI will provide the data needed to enable civil society to hold leaders accountable to their climate commitments and increase ambition.This investment compliments CIFF's ICAT programme.

      "Description  The Climate Policy Initiative and the China Centre for Energy Economics Research (CCER) undertook much needed research into mapping the landscape of the financial and institutional landscape of Chinese finance for domestic and international projects, and analyse potential interventions for philanthropy.The primary outputs of the investment were two reports:Historically, public finance from Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), as well as national development agencies and financial institutions in developed countries, has contributed significantly to overseas coal power development, to provide electricity access at low cost in developing countries and to support exports. Institutions such as the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, the Export-Import Bank of U.S., and the World Bank Group played important roles in financing coal power projects. In recent years, however, the Chinese government has been increasing its financial support of overseas coal power projects as backing from traditional lenders started to wane, and has become a key player in this space. In addition to public finance, in recent years Chinese power generation developers have also begun to invest directly in foreign coal power plants. In September 2015, the U.S. and China issued a joint statement highlighting China’s commitment to restrict public finance to projects with high pollution or carbon emissions, internationally as well as domestically.1 The practical details of this major policy change have yet to be defined – but the impact of this commitment may be significant.The aim of the report was to help the wider community better understand the scale of Chinese finance in a larger global context as well as the drivers and economic incentives for the country and stakeholders involved.The report thus answers the following questions:This report focused on crucial questions around the financing of Chinese coal power plants namely:A synopsis of the report is as follows:This project begins to explore a number of questions. In Section 2, it looks into the instrumental role that low-cost coal power generation has played in helping fuel China’s infrastructure-led economic development. In Section 3, it identifies the owners of coal-fired power generation capacity in China and highlight the critical role that State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) have played in the deployment of coal power. In Section 4, it turns to the three government policy drivers that have supported SOEs: top-down targets from China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), government-set electricity tariffs that ensure relative long-term profitability, and the provision of almost unlimited, cheap government finance to SOEs so that they do not need to rely solely on pure corporate or project finance. In Section 5, it looks into macroeconomic changes that have occurred recently in China and how government support is evolving under this changing economic landscape. Section 6 looks into the complex relationship between state-owned enterprises and the central government – making the case that SOEs are gradually evolving into self-sustaining entities that are incentivised to continue expanding their coal-fired power generation assets on which external finance and policy support have limited impact.The programme culminated in two reports that offered the analysis of the mapping and provided a detailed insight into the field of coal financing in China.The primary aim of this work was to enable the philanthropic community to better understand the landscape of coal finance and then determine where best to invest resources.  The ambition was to increase the impact of philanthropic resources by improving understanding of coal-related financial flows.\n",

It supports two prominent alliances – the High Ambition Coalition and the Climate Vulnerable Forum – to help leaders to lock in gains from the Paris Agreement, and  climate action on a variety of agendas. This is achieved in a variety of ways, including tracking and synthesising information, providing relevant technical research, and conducting advocacy support to raise overall ambition on tackling climate change.Track 0 was hugely successful in securing support for the concept of net-zero emissions as part of the Paris Agreement. There is now more work needed to lock in those Paris ambitions and ensure implementation of the commitments and goals set there. In the coming years, the international community will increase efforts to deliver on these commitments. Track 0 will continue its role in supporting the efforts of those countries leading the charge to achieve the climate goals on the road to 2020.Both CIFF and Track 0 believe that the law is a critical tool for holding governments and major actors to account for delivering their climate commitments. Track 0 is engaged in developing legal strategies to secure accountability and compliance with domestic and international climate laws. In order to maximise climate gains from the Paris Agreement, Track 0 will monitor and synthesise information that is of use to the climate change community, provide scientific and technical research, deliver UNFCCC related legal advice, and provide advice on how emissions from global shipping may be reduced. Work is currently in hand on regulating shipping sector emissions through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).Track 0 has worked to support the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) in its climate change strategies. The RMI is a prominent member of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, which has committed to limiting global warming to 1.5°C (or less) and to lead the world in achieving low-carbon and, ultimately, zero-carbon economies.The RMI is also a leader within the High Ambition Coalition. Two of the High Ambition Coalition’s key priorities (ensuring the Paris climate deal entered into force and securing radical HFC cuts) have already been met, and work continues on the aim of achieving a global aviation emissions deal.\n",
